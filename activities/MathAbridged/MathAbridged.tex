Trapped in the frightning country of \textbf{Badlandia}, your brave group of four adventurers has almost escaped to the lush hills of \textbf{Nicetopia}. All that remains is one dark, rickity bridge...

As you plan your escape, the earth begins to tremble. An \textbf{earthquake} is coming, and you only have minutes to spare before the bridge \textbf{collapses}!

\begin{itemize}
\item Each person crosses the bridge at different speeds: \textbf{1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes}.
\item You have one torch, which only has enough light for \textbf{at most two people crossing the bridge at a time}.
\item If two people cross the bridge at the same time, the both move at the same speed as the \textbf{slower} adventurer, so they can share the torch.
\end{itemize}

You don't know how much time you have - can you get your group across the bridge in the fastest time possible?!
