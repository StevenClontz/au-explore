Math isn't just about equations and shapes. Studying two-player games and determining which player has a \textbf{winning strategy} which cannot be defeated by the opponent is an aspect of \textbf{Game Theory}.

\

Here's a couple of examples. Can you figure out if \textbf{Player 1} or \textbf{Player 2} has a winning strategy?

\

\noindent\textbf{\Huge Take One-or-Two}

\textbf{Setup:} Place 15 tokens on the table.

\textbf{Gameplay:} Players alternate taking one or two tokens from the table.

\textbf{Object:} To take the last token from the table.

\

\noindent\textbf{\Huge Take One-or-Two-or-Three}

Same as Take One-or-Two except players can take three tokens from the table.

\

\noindent\textbf{\Huge Nim}

\textbf{Setup:} Place 5 tokens in 3 rows on the table.

\textbf{Gameplay:} Players alternate taking as many tokens as they like, as long as they are from the same row.

\textbf{Object:} To take the last token from the table.
